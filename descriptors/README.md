# descriptors

This directory is created specially for placing differend kinds of gesture descriptors here.
Every descendant of `AbstractGestureDescriptor` class should be placed here by default.

Also it would be nice if you place a brief description of your class in this README.

## AbstractGestureDescriptor

The base abstract class for every descriptor. All of them should be inherited from this class to integrate properly in the system.

## HistogramGestureDescriptor

This descriptor is used inside Histogram-based GDA. See `../histogram` for more.
